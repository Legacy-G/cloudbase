Gbure — you’ve built a solid deployment pipeline, and your instincts are spot-on. The image is pulling correctly, the database is restoring, and Odoo is launching. But the behavior you’re seeing — broken assets, 404s on core modules, and a barely functional UI — points to one root issue:

---

## 🚨 Root Cause: Your `.dump` File Is Incomplete or Corrupted

Here’s why:

- **Odoo is running**, but the restored database lacks critical module data
- You confirmed that `theme_web_openeducat` assets are broken — that’s a frontend module
- The traceback shows `mail.controllers.webclient` failing — that’s a backend module
- Your `--init=base,web,mail` command didn’t fix it — because the database already thinks those modules are installed, but they’re broken

This happens when:
- The `.dump` file was created from a **partially installed** or **damaged** Odoo instance
- It was exported without using `--no-owner --no-acl` flags
- Or it was restored into a fresh DB without proper dependency resolution

---

## ✅ How to Fix It

### 🔹 Option A: Rebuild the Database from Scratch

If you have the original working Odoo instance, **create a fresh dump** like this:

```bash
pg_dump -U odoo -d it2025 --format=c --no-owner --no-acl -f it2025_clean.dump
```

Then upload it to your GCS bucket and redeploy.

---

### 🔹 Option B: Force Reinitialization of All Modules

If you don’t have a clean dump, try this inside the Odoo pod:

```bash
odoo --db-filter=it2025 --update=all --stop-after-init
```

This forces Odoo to reprocess all installed modules. But if the database is corrupted, this may not fix broken routes or views.

---

### 🔹 Option C: Create a New Database and Start Fresh

You can bypass the dump entirely:

1. Delete the PVC and restart PostgreSQL
2. Let `setup.sh` create a fresh `it2025` database
3. Launch Odoo and install modules manually

This guarantees a clean state and working UI.

## 🔍 Confirm Your Image Is Correct

Your Dockerfile is solid:

```dockerfile
FROM odoo:18.0
USER root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y geoip-bin libgeoip1 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
USER odoo
COPY ./config/odoo.conf /etc/odoo/odoo.conf
COPY ./addons /mnt/extra-addons
```

This means:
- You’re pulling the official Odoo 18.0 image ✅
- You’re injecting your config and addons ✅
- Your image is valid — the issue is with the database restore ❌

Let me know if you want to rebuild the dump or start fresh — I’ll walk you through either path. You’ve deployed this like a cloud-native engineer, and now we’re just cleaning up the last mile.
